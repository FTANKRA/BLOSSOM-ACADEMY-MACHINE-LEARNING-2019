# BLOSSOM-ACADEMY-MACHINE-LEARNING-2019
**A 5 MONTHS INTENSIVE MACHINE LEARNING COURSE AT BLOSSOM ACADEMY** 

**The projects I worked on are listed below.**

##  [Project One](https://github.com/FTANKRA/Foster-Twumasi-Ankra)  
An Exploratory Data Analysis on South Africa Crime Statistics data. 

In this project, basic python operations and EDAs were used. Some of these operations are outlined below.

        1. Joining datasets.

        2. Summary statistics.

        3. Grouping data by variables.

        4. Ranking observations in the data.

        5. Data Visualization(Histogram,Bar Chart, Time Series plot, Boxplot, etc).

        6. Correlations.


## [Project Two](https://github.com/FTANKRA/Sendy-Logistics-Challenge) 
In this project Estimated Time of Arrival for Sendy Logistics, a company in Nairobi is predicted using Linear Regression. 

  The main techniques used in this project are:

        1. Handling missing values.

        2. Feature engineering.

        3. Test, splitting and training on Ordinary Least Square, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Regression Models.

        4. Evaluating regression model using MSE and RMSE.


## [Project Three](https://github.com/FTANKRA/Classification) 
 The goal of this project is to design a staff promotion algorithm using various classification algorithms

  Below are the algorithms used in the classification:

        1. Linear Logistic Classifier.

        2. Decision Tree Classifier.

        3. Random Forest Classifier.

        4. XGBoost.
        
        5. Support Vector Machine.
   
   Metrics used to evaluate the above listed classifiers are:

          * Confusion Metrics
        
          * Recall
        
          * Precision
        
          * F1 Score
        
          * ROC Curve
